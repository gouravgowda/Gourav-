# 🚀 Next Steps - Push to GitHub

Your code is now committed locally! Here's how to push it to GitHub:

## **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `ai-mental-health-companion` (or your choice)
3. Description: `Premium AI-powered mental health tracking app with glassmorphism UI`
4. Keep it **Public** (so you can share easily)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## **Step 2: Connect and Push**

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Run these:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\GOURAV GOWDA\OneDrive\Desktop\ai mental tracking"

# Add your GitHub repo as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-mental-health-companion.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

## **Step 3: Share Your App!**

Once pushed, your GitHub URL will be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-mental-health-companion
```
